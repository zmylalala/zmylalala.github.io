      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Minyu Zhang</strong>, a research assistant at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics (Big Data Analytics and Computation) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the University of Waterloo.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic interests lie in the intersection of statistical modeling, data analysis, and AI-driven applications in social science. I am particularly drawn to data-intensive approaches that support decision-making, prediction, and evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently preparing to apply for PhD programs and seeking new research assistant roles. With a background in mathematics and hands-on experience in data product design, academic research, and machine learning projects, I am looking to further develop my skills in areas such as <em>applied statistics</em>, <em>econometrics</em>, or <em>quantitative psychology</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to get in touch with me through the links on the left.

          <strong>Homepage Optimization of Netflix using Response Surface Methodology</strong><br>
          <p>
            Applied Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to identify optimal combinations of preview length, preview size, and tile size to minimize user browsing time on the Netflix homepage. Conducted 2^k full factorial design, steepest descent method, and second-order central composite design. Found optimal settings at 100s preview length and 55% preview size, reducing average browsing time to 15.10 seconds.

            Built a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to classify 13 types of household garbage from images. Preprocessed images using <code>skimage</code>, resized them to 100Ã—100Ã—3, and trained the model on labeled datasets. The model achieved accurate predictions such as distinguishing between recyclable (glass, plastic, metal) and non-recyclable waste types.
